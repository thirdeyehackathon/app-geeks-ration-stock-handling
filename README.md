Description:
	The main objective of our project is to solve the problem faced by the public in getting the ration at the correct time and to avoid the overcrowding of people at the ration shop. For this purpose we develop an app that will be used by the person in-charge of the ration shop. The list of customers belonging to that particular shop is maintained in the database along with their phone number. The customers are grouped by their ration card category. When the stock arrives the person will send an alert message to the customers.
